phpGACL FAQ - v0.1

Q: I already have adodb installed in my include path for other pages.  I already use an include statement pointing to "adodb/adodb.inc.php".  How do I get phpgacl to use this up-to-date copy of adodb?
A: 1. Edit phpgacl/config.inc.php so that $adodb_dir reflects the location of the adodb library in your include path.
	2. Edit phpgacl/admin/gacl_admin.inc.php. Change the adodb include near the top of the file from this:
	require_once('../'.$adodb_dir.'/adodb.inc.php');

	To this:
	require_once($adodb_dir.'/adodb.inc.php');

	3. Rename the phpgacl/adodb folder to something else like adodb_x and reload the phpgacl/admin/acl_admin.php page to ensure it works.
	4. Erase the adodb directory installed with phpgacl.

Q: How do I move the phpGACL files out of my website tree while leaving a link in the tree for administration?
A: 1. Go to your website root.
	2. Move the phpgacl directory to your includes directory and create a symlink to the admin directory where you want the admin tool to go.  For example:
      mv phpgacl/ /www/includes_directory
      ln -s /www/includes_directory/phpgacl/admin/ gacl
	3. Now surfing to http://yoursite.net/gacl/acl_admin.php will take you to the admin page.
