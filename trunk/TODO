* Write API documentation.

* Move sort_groups() and format_groups() to the API. Confirm format_groups works properly when given a starting group_id.

* Write tutorial, some people may find phpGACL difficult to figure out.

* Clean up Administration interface and add many more sanity checks

* Improve setup script, including support for more databases

* Implement some sort of caching, it seems ADODB's caching is very poor. It didn't improve the speed at all.
