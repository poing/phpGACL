* Create templates_c for Smarty in setup.php, figure out permissions for it as well. Write this in the FAQ/README.

* Write "mock" implementations to show off some of phpGACL's benefits.

* Write tutorial, some people may find phpGACL difficult to figure out.

* Implement some sort of caching (custom version of Pears Cache Lite with hashed directories?) , it seems ADODB's caching is very poor.
    It didn't improve the speed at all.
