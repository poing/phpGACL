Fri July 04 2003
	- Updated table schema for the acl table. Added the acl_section table, and the phpgacl table.
	- Added ACL sections. The purpose of these is like all other sections, to simply classify objects.
		For example, you may want to differentiate between automatically created ACLs (System ACLs) and
		manually created ACLs (User ACLs). As some installations may have several thousand automatically created
		ACLs, its nice to filter these out.
	- add_group_object() now returns TRUE if the object is already assigned to the group.

Tue July 01 2003
	- Fixed security bug that could allow someone to see your database password.
	
Mon June 16 2003

Sun Mar 09 2003
	- Fixed small bug in API function get_object_id() where it referenced the $name variable,
		but $name was never used. If the function was used properly, this shouldn't have affected anything.
		Thanks to: Harald Fielker <fielker@informatik.fh-augsburg.de> for pointing this out.
		
Sat Mar 01 2003
	- Fixed up the layers with AXO show/hide functionality. Usable, but still needs improvement.

	- Fixed bug in del_group(), as it neglected to remove the object mapping. Thanks to Thomas <tstruebi@pentacon.ch> for pointing this out.
	
Tue Feb 18 2003
	- Added 'force_cache_expire' option, so the cache is automaticalled expired when ACL/Group modifications take place.
		This should allow the cache_expire_time to be greatly increased (86400?) and still maintain instance updates.
	- Removed un-needed table joins in search_acl() resulting in a large performance increase. 
	
Mon Feb 17 2003
	- Added "limit" to ARO select query in group_assign.php

Thu Jan 31 2003
	- Added conflict detection to add_acl();
	
Thu Jan 30 2003
	- Created search_acl() to search for ACLs mapped to specific objects. This should also work for detecting conflicting ACLs.
	- Created shift_acl() that basically does the opposite of append_acl(). Remove just the specific objects from the ACL mapping.
	
Wed Jan 29 2003
	- Created append_acl() function for simply appending ACO/ARO/ARO Groups/AXO/AXO Groups on to an already existing ACL.
	
Mon Jan 28 2003
	- Added ACL searching.
	- Added ACL debug page.

Sun Nov 17 2002
	- format_groups() function wasn't recursing as efficiently as it could be. Fixed.
	- Re-wrote API aro/aco/group specific functions to be generic to help support AXO's.
	- Re-wrote aro/aco/group specific admin scripts to be generic to help support AXO's.
	- Added AXO support to acl_admin.php.
	- Updated gacl.inc.php to support AXO's.
	
Mon Nov 11 2002
	- Changed the ordering of the main acl_query() SQL query. It wasn't properly preferring the deepest groups ACLs. - Thanks to Mauro
		for spotting this one and helping me track it down.
	- Fixed bug that prevented ACO/ARO's with the same 'value' in different sections from being assigned to an ACL. - Thanks to Martino
	- Fixed bug that made it seem like assigning a single ARO to a group really added all AROs with the same value to that group. - Thanks to Martino
	- Fixed bug causing virtual subtree'ing to only traverse 2 levels of the tree. - Thanks to Martino
	- Used dirname(__FILE__) to remove the need for users to manually set the root path in config.inc.php.
	
Wed Oct 23 2002
	- Switched away from ID's in favor of VALUES for most functions, including acl_check(). Broke all backwards compatibility.
	- Modified DB Schema to reflect above.
	- When ARO/ACO values are changed, the API will modify said values in all tables.
	- Added a variable for phpGACL's current path. 
	
Wed Oct 09 2002 
	- Added "hidden" flags to relavent API functions
	- Added Oracle 8i schema to setup.php
	- Changed group "level" table column name to "tree_level", as the old name "level" was a reserved word in some db's.
		MySQL: ALTER TABLE `groups_path` CHANGE `level` `tree_level` INT(12) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL
	- Modified a few of the queries to be more portable, specifically for Oracle's sake.
	- Added a FAQ entry regarding individualized item permissions. 
	
Wed Sep 25 2002
	- Added multi-layer ACO checking to ACL_QUERY()
	- Removed multi-layer ACO checking in favor of "dual" acl checking. ie:
		If you want to set ACL's on a contact list. Create ACO's for each Contact in the list.
		and create more generic ACO's for things like "View - Contacts", "Edit - Contacts".
		Then simply create an ACL with ACO's "View - Contacts" AND "Contact ID: 15"
		Then if ( acl_check("View - Contacts", "John Doe") AND acl_check("Contact ID: 15", "John Doe"))
		Very simple, and should be just as fast, or faster then adding more bloat to the database.
	- Added "hidden" flag to ACO, ACO Sections, ARO, and ARO sections.
