	- Added "hidden" flags to relavent API functions
	- Added Oracle 8i schema to setup.php
	- Changed group "level" table column name to "tree_level", as the old name "level" was a reserved word in some db's.
		MySQL: ALTER TABLE `groups_path` CHANGE `level` `tree_level` INT(12) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL
	- Modified a few of the queries to be more portable, specifically for Oracle's sake.

	- Added multi-layer ACO checking to ACL_QUERY()
	- Removed multi-layer ACO checking in favor of "dual" acl checking. ie:
		If you want to set ACL's on a contact list. Create ACO's for each Contact in the list.
		and create more generic ACO's for things like "View - Contacts", "Edit - Contacts".
		Then simply create an ACL with ACO's "View - Contacts" AND "Contact ID: 15"
		Then if ( acl_check("View - Contacts", "John Doe") AND acl_check("Contact ID: 15", "John Doe"))
		Very simple, and should be just as fast, or faster then adding more bloat to the database.
	- Added "hidden" flag to ACO, ACO Sections, ARO, and ARO sections.
