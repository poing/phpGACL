* Add "3rd layer" support for ACL'ing individual items.
    Two ways we can do this:
        1. Use the current ACO's, and add a 3rd param to acl_check($aco_id, $aro_id, $aco_id) or acl_check(array($aco_id,$aco_id), $aro_id)
        2. Add a completely seperate layer (what should I call it? ACOb for now), acl_check($aco_id, $aro_id, $acob_id)
        
* Get rid of freepolls.com, they're always down.

* Create include files with queries in each for the different databases. ie: include($db->db_type."-custom_sql.php");

* Write "mock" implementations to show off some of phpGACL's benefits.

* Write tutorial, some people may find phpGACL difficult to figure out.

* Oracle compatibility: Apply second path from Fred Cohen
