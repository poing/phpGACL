* Ponder subtree support. This is a feature that would allow the developer to basically "chroot" to a specific
group before an ACL check is performed. Useful if you have overlapping ACO's.

* Add feature to turn off group inheritance.

* Write "mock" implementations to show off some of phpGACL's benefits.

* Write API documentation.

* Move sort_groups() and format_groups() to the API. Confirm format_groups works properly when given a starting group_id.

* Write tutorial, some people may find phpGACL difficult to figure out.

* Clean up Administration interface and add many more sanity checks

* Improve setup script, including support for more databases

* Implement some sort of caching (custom version of Pears Cache Lite with hashed directories?) , it seems ADODB's caching is very poor.
    It didn't improve the speed at all.
