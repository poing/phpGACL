REQUIREMENTS:

Smarty requires PHP 4.0.6 or later.

INSTALLATION:

* copy the Smarty.class.php, Smarty_Compile.class.php Config_File.class.php
  scripts and the plugins directory to a directory that is in your PHP
  include_path, or set the SMARTY_DIR constant and put your class files in this
  directory.

* create a "templates", "configs", and a "templates_c" directory,
  be sure to set the appropriate directory settings in Smarty for them. If they
  are located in the same directory as your application, they shouldn't need to
  be modified. Be sure the "templates_c" directory is writable by your web
  server user (usually nobody). chown nobody:nobody templates_c; chmod 700
  templates_c You can also chmod 777 this directory, but be aware of security
  issues for multi-user systems. If you are using Smarty's built-in caching,
  create a "cache" directory and also chown nobody:nobody.

* setup your php and template files. A good working example is included to get
  you started. Also see the QUICKSTART guide for some more examples.

* TECHNICAL NOTE: If you do not have access to the php.ini file, you can change
  non-server settings (such as your include_path) with the ini_set() command.
  example: ini_set("include_path",".:/usr/local/lib/php");
