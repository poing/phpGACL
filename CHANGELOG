	- Re-wrote aro/aco/group specific admin scripts to be generic to help support AXO's.
	- Added AXO support to acl_admin.php.
	- Updated gacl.inc.php to support AXO's.

	- Changed the ordering of the main acl_query() SQL query. It wasn't properly preferring the deepest groups ACLs. - Thanks to Mauro
		for spotting this one and helping me track it down.
	- Fixed bug that prevented ACO/ARO's with the same 'value' in different sections from being assigned to an ACL. - Thanks to Martino
	- Fixed bug that made it seem like assigning a single ARO to a group really added all AROs with the same value to that group. - Thanks to Martino
	- Fixed bug causing virtual subtree'ing to only traverse 2 levels of the tree. - Thanks to Martino
	- Used dirname(__FILE__) to remove the need for users to manually set the root path in config.inc.php.

	- Switched away from ID's in favor of VALUES for most functions, including acl_check(). Broke all backwards compatibility.
	- Modified DB Schema to reflect above.
	- When ARO/ACO values are changed, the API will modify said values in all tables.
	- Added a variable for phpGACL's current path. 
	
Wed Oct 09 2002 
	- Added "hidden" flags to relavent API functions
	- Added Oracle 8i schema to setup.php
	- Changed group "level" table column name to "tree_level", as the old name "level" was a reserved word in some db's.
		MySQL: ALTER TABLE `groups_path` CHANGE `level` `tree_level` INT(12) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL
	- Modified a few of the queries to be more portable, specifically for Oracle's sake.
	- Added a FAQ entry regarding individualized item permissions.

	- Added multi-layer ACO checking to ACL_QUERY()
	- Removed multi-layer ACO checking in favor of "dual" acl checking. ie:
		If you want to set ACL's on a contact list. Create ACO's for each Contact in the list.
		and create more generic ACO's for things like "View - Contacts", "Edit - Contacts".
		Then simply create an ACL with ACO's "View - Contacts" AND "Contact ID: 15"
		Then if ( acl_check("View - Contacts", "John Doe") AND acl_check("Contact ID: 15", "John Doe"))
		Very simple, and should be just as fast, or faster then adding more bloat to the database.
	- Added "hidden" flag to ACO, ACO Sections, ARO, and ARO sections.
